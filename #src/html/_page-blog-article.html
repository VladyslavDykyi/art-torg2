				The name Ruth Asawa is synoynmous with the transformative power of wire sculpture and a steadfast commitment
				to accessibility in art. She worked long hours, attended meetings and performances in the evenings, and
				often drew late into the night. She was curious about how things were made and enjoyed hearing from others
				how to make them.<br><br>

				Adding to the allure of Ruth Asawa's artistic legacy, <a href="#">Fine Estate Inc</a>., a San Rafael-based
				gallery, is
				currently featuring <a href="#">Untitled S.391</a> in their upcoming <a href="#">‘California Dreaming Fine
				Art and Jewelry’</a> auction on
				May 21st. This captivating wire sculpture, crafted circa 1958, showcases six interlocking brass wire
				trumpets. Notably, the piece has never been offered for sale or publicly exhibited until now, making it a
				truly fresh discovery for art enthusiasts. Originally, Asawa exchanged this sculpture for piano lessons for
				three of her six children, and it adorned the home studio of her piano teacher, Florence Oertel Hartford,
				until her passing.<br><br>

				During the final stages of World War II, Ruth Asawa, while still interned at the Rohwer War Relocation
				Center in Arkansas, found herself granted permission to enroll at Black Mountain College. Under the guidance
				of influential teachers like Josef Albers, Asawa's artistic abilities blossomed. This blog post explores her
				journey, from early experiments with form and repetition to the remarkable legacy she left behind.<br><br>

				Born in 1926 into a family of seven children on a modest truck farm in Norwalk, California, Ruth Asawa
				exemplified the resilient American spirit. Throughout her early life, she faced numerous challenges but
				refused to be deterred. Asawa's unwavering determination propelled her forward as she tirelessly pursued her
				artistic aspirations while simultaneously establishing programs to foster artistic expression in others. Her
				devotion to her craft and family formed the core of her being, guiding her through every hardship she
				encountered.<br><br>

				Today, the impact of Ruth Asawa's artistic contributions can be witnessed in various public spaces,
				including the Educational Tower of the De Young Museum. These breathtaking wire sculptures, showcased on a
				permanent basis, are freely accessible to all visitors—a testament to Asawa's belief in making art available
				to everyone. One such notable artwork is "Mermaids," an enchanting sculpture located in Ghirardelli Square.
				Inspired by her friend Andrea Jepson, Asawa skillfully captured the essence of aquatic life in this
				masterpiece. Moreover, Asawa's dedication extended beyond her own creations, as she played a vital role in
				starting 50 school art programs and served as a member of the San Francisco Arts Council.<br>
				As the legacy of Ruth Asawa continues to inspire and captivate art lovers, the upcoming auction of <a
					href="#">Untitled S.391</a> presents a unique opportunity to own a piece of her remarkable journey. With
				an estimated value of
				$200,000-300,000, this exquisite wire sculpture carries the essence of Asawa's ingenuity and personal
				connections, further enriching its artistic significance.
